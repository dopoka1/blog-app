The goal for this project is to make a blog site using the MERN stack. 
It should include the capability for users to: 

1. register
2. login
3. create and modify their posts
4. view other posts

Currently the sites homepage looks like:

TODO:

- Improve user feedback on account registration
- Posts are currently stored in database but not being displayed on site.
